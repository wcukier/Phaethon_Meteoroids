Code
====

**A note on units**: Unless otherwise noted, all quantities in this code are given in units derived from meters, grams, and seconds.  I (Wolf Cukier) apologize for this awful choice of units and do question why I did not settle on cgs or mks units but the code is written this way and it is too much of a pain to rewrite it.
